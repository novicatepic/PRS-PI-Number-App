# Number PI Mini Project

Based on the description of the Monte Carlo simulation procedure (page 34 in the script), write a program in any programming language to calculate the value of Pi. Allow the user to choose one of two options at the beginning â€“ the number of randomly generated values or the number of decimals that should match the true value.
